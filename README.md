# Job Bookmarking Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to bookmark job-related websites and store them in a Flask-based backend. The stored bookmarks are then saved into an SQLite3 database for easy access and management.

## Features

- **Bookmark Job Listings**: Quickly save job-related web pages directly from Chrome.
- **Flask Backend**: The extension sends bookmarked job pages to a Flask server.
- **SQLite3 Database Storage**: Flask stores the bookmarked jobs in an SQLite3 database for persistent access.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SrishtiTurki/Karyatra.git
   ```
2. Load the extension into Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` folder.

## Backend Setup (Flask + SQLite3)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install flask flask-cors sqlite3
   ```
2. Run the Flask server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. The backend should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any job listing website.
2. Click the extension icon to bookmark the page.
3. The page URL is sent to the Flask backend and stored in SQLite3.
4. Access your saved job bookmarks through the extension UI.

# Skill Gap Analysis System

This project identifies skill gaps by analyzing job descriptions and comparing them with user skills. It extracts required skills from job listings, processes the data, and generates a skill gap report.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts job descriptions dynamically.
- **Skill Extraction**: Identifies required skills from job listings.
- **Gap Analysis**: Compares job requirements with user skills.
- **Report Generation**: Outputs missing skills for targeted improvement.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone -b Skill-Gap https://github.com/SrishtiTurki/Karyatra.git
   ```

## Running the Analysis

Run the scripts in the following order:

1. **Start the Flask backend**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Run the main processing script**
   ```sh
   python main_script.py
   ```
3. **Perform skill gap analysis**
   ```sh
   python skill_gap.py
   ```

## File Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ skill-gap-analysis
 â”œâ”€â”€ app.py  # Flask server
 â”œâ”€â”€ main_script.py  # Job description processing
 â”œâ”€â”€ skill_gap.py  # Skill gap analysis
 â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

## API Endpoints

- **`POST /extract_skills`**: Extracts skills from job descriptions.
  - Request: `{ "job_description": "We need Python and SQL expertise." }`
  - Response: `{ "skills": ["Python", "SQL"] }`

- **`POST /analyze_gap`**: Compares job skills with user skills.
  - Request: `{ "user_skills": ["Python", "Excel"] }`
  - Response: `{ "missing_skills": ["SQL"] }`

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a recommendation system for learning resources.
- Enhanced NLP-based skill extraction.
- User authentication and profile management.
